# Mortgage
This assignment focuses on the design, implementation and testing of a Python program to calculate values related to the purchase of a home using a traditional mortgage loan system
When prospective home buyers which to purchase a new home, they can take out a loan from a bank to allow them to buy the home without having the full purchase price. This is called a mortgage. The mortgage loan is paid back to the bank over time with interest. When looking at available homes, it is helpful to understand how various factors impact the mortgage. A buyer must be aware of the principal loan amount, the down payment, the annual percentage rate (APR) of the loan, the length of the loan, the property taxes, the cost of living within a given area, the cost of homeownerâ€™s insurance, and realtor costs. We will ignore a few of these factors to simplify the problem space.
For this assignment, you will design a program that asks the users to provide some of the following details: the desired location of the house, the desired size of the house in square feet, the desired maximum monthly payment, the expected down payment, and the current APR. Using this information, the program will compute and output either the estimated monthly payment or the maximum square footage that the buyer should consider given the values provided.
